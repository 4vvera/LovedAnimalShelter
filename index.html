            <h2>A Few Words About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At Loved Pets Animal Rescue, we believe all animals deserve a chance to find a loving forever home.
We provide initial veterinary care to rescued animals, then work to match each animal with a human
family to love them and keep them safe forever. All animals are screened for diseases upon arrival,
washed and groomed, and then added to our website for adoptive families to see. All potential
adoptive families are also screened for adoption history, household lifestyle, and commitment to
providing a safe and loving home.
            </p>
            <p>
               We can always use volunteers to help keep our shelter open! Volunteers are needed to bathe and
groom animals, play with pets to help them socialize and keep them happy, clean kennels and
screening rooms, and help with administrative tasks in the office. If you’re interested in volunteering,
please complete the steps below.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the process of the screening?</h3>
            <p>The adoption screening process helps ensure that both the adopter and the pet are well-matched and prepared for a successful, lifelong relationship. First, you’ll need to complete an adoption application, which asks about your living situation, experience with pets, and household environment (e.g., whether you have children or other animals).
<br>
              <br>
After submitting your application, a staff member will contact you for a follow-up interview to discuss your application in more detail. During this interview, we’ll review your answers, talk about your lifestyle, and ensure that you understand the responsibilities of pet ownership.
<br>
              <br>
In some cases, we may require a home visit to make sure your living environment is safe for the pet you’re interested in adopting. If everything checks out, we’ll guide you through the final steps of the adoption process, including the adoption fee, and preparing to bring your new pet home.</p>

            <h3>How can I report a lost or found pet?</h3>
            <p>If you've lost a pet or found one, contact our shelter immediately. We can help you search for lost pets or reunite found animals with their owners. Additionally, we recommend posting on social media, checking local shelters, and visiting our website for lost pet listings.</p>
